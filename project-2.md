# Project 1: Simple TCP over UDP Sockets

## Revisions

* **April 22, 2016**: Initial version of the project description.


## Overview

The purpose of this project is to learn socket programming and the basic of TCP protocol.
The second project should be implemented on top of the first project.
You need to change your socket from TCP to UDP which is a unreliable protocol.
Your client should receive a requested file even though some packets are dropped or delayed.

## Task Description

The client and the server work in the same way as it did in the first project.
However, there are packet loss and delay on the link between them.
To make the link reliable, you need to implement some parts of TCP such as the sequence number, the acknowledgement, and the congestion control.
Once you get a reliable link, then the file transmission must be successful.


## Basic Transmission over UDP


- In this project, you will be implementing a simple congestion window-based  TCP protocol.
 You must write one program implementing the client side, and another program
 implementing the server side. Only C/C++ are allowed to use in this project as you did in the first project.

- The client and the server will communicate using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) socket, which does not guarantee data delivery.

- The initial window size starts from 1.

- The retransmission time out value XXX milliseconds

- The client should establish a connection to the server by using three-way handshake.
During the handshake, the server has to send its initial sequence number to the client.

- After establishing the connection, The client will first send a HTTP request message to the server.
If the file exists, the server will divide the entire file into multiple packets,
and then add some header information to each packet before sending them to the client.
The maximum packet size is 1K (1024) bytes including all the headers.

- It is up to you what information you want to include in the header (e.g. Source, Destination port etc...),
but you will at least need a sequence number field.
You are free to define what kind of messages you will require, and the format of the messages.
You can create a large file being requested on your own, but make sure the file is
transmitted in multiple packets.

- Note that your programs will act as both a network application (file transfer program) as well as a reliable
transport layer protocol built over the unreliable UDP transport layer.


## Error Handling

Although using UDP does not ensure reliability of data transfer, the actual rate of packet loss or corruption in LAN
may be too low to test your program.  Therefore, we are going to emulate packet loss by using 'tc' command in linux.

- The file transmission should be completed successfully, unless the packet loss rate is 100\%.
- The timer on both the client and the server should work correctly to retransmit the lost packet.

## Congestion Control

Your server has to adjust the window size depending on the link status.

- Slow start: the window size will be doubled until it meets the slow start threshold value.
- Congestion Avoidance: the window size added by one if the window size is larger than ssthresh.
- If a packet is lost, the server has to adjust the window size and also the ssthresh.
- if the server receives 3 duplicate ACKs, then it has to use fast retransmission and fast recovery.


## Hints

The best way to approach this project is in incremental steps.  Do not try to implement all of the functionality at once.

- First, assume there is no packet loss. Just have the server send a packet, the receiver respond with an ACK,
and so on.

- Second, introduce a large file transmission. This means you must divide the file into multiple packets and transmit the packets based on the current window size.

- Third, introduce packet loss.  Now you have to add a timer at the sender side for each packet. Also congestion control features should be implemented for the successful file transmission.

The credit of your project is distributed among the required functions. If you only finish part of the requirements, we still
give you partial credit. So please do the project incrementally.



## Requirements

- You must use an UDP socket for both sender and receiver.

- You should print messages to the screen when the server or the client is sending or receiving packets.  Your message should include information:

    * whether it is a DATA packet, an ACK or a retransmission packet
    * the sequence number
    * packet lost
    * timer value
    * etc.

    Such messages will be helpful for you to debug the programs, and we can use them to examine the correctness of your programs.

- The maximum packet size is 1Kbytes (1024 bytes) including a header.

- The window size is given in the unit of bytes. (Not in the unit of packet count) For example, if the window size is 5 Kbytes, then five packets can be transmitted simultaneously.

- The sequence number is given in the unit of bytes as well. The maximum sequence number is 30 Kbytes. You have to reset back the sequence number when it reaches the maximum value.

- Timer should work properly for each transmitted packet.


## Submission

To submit your project, you need to prepare:

1. All your source code and Makefile (no binaries) as `.tar.gz` archive.

2. A PDF project report that describes
   * the high level design of your server and client;
   * the problems your ran into and how you solved the problems;
   * additional instructions to build your project (if your project uses some other libraries);
   * how you tested your code and why.
   * the contribution of each team member (up to 3 members in one team) and their UID

Put all these above into a package and submit to CCLE.

Please make sure:

1. your code can compile
2. no unnecessary files in the package.

Otherwise, your will not get any credit.
