* **April 26, 2016**: Initial version of the project description.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of TCP protocol, including connection establishment and congestion control.
You will need to implement a simple data transfer client and server applications, using UDP sockets as an unreliable transport.
The goal of the project is to design and implement your own transport protocol headers on top of UDP to make it as a reliable transfer protocol.
Your client should receive data even though some packets are dropped or delayed.

## Task Description

The developed client should establish connection to the developed server, after which the server will need to transfer data to the client.
Individual packets sent by the client and the server may be lost or reordered.
Therefore, your task is to make reliable data transfer by implementing parts of TCP such as the sequence number, the acknowledgement, and the congestion control.

The project will be graded by testing transfer a single file over the unreliable link.
Your second project does not need to be extended from your first project (if you extend, you will get extra credit, see below).
Instead, you can simply implement a single threaded server that starts data transfer as soon as the connection is established.

## Basic Transmission over UDP

- In this project, you will be implementing a simple congestion window based reliable transport protocol similar to TCP.
 You must write one program implementing the client side, and another program implementing the server side. Only C/C++ are allowed to use in this project as you did in the first project.

- The client and the server will communicate using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) socket, which does not guarantee data delivery.

- The initial window size starts from 1.

- The fixed retransmission timeout value 500 milliseconds (adaptive RTO for the extra credit)

- The client should establish a connection to the server using a three-way handshake.  During the handshake, the server has to send its initial sequence number to the client.

- After establishing the connection, the server should send the specified in the command-line file, dividing it into multiple packets and adding necessary header information. The maximum packet size should be 1 Kbytes (1024 bytes) bytes including all the headers.

- Command-line specification for client and server program:

        ./client SERVER-HOST-OR-IP PORT-NUMBER

        ./server PORT-NUMBER FILE-NAME

- You have to design your own transport layer header for this project.  It is up to you what information you want to include in the header (e.g., Sequence number, Acknowledge Number, and etc.), but you will at least need a sequence number field.  You are free to define what kind of messages you will require, and the format of the messages.

  **The designed packet format must be described in the project report.**

- Note that your programs will act as both a network application (file transfer program) as well as a reliable
transport layer protocol built over the unreliable UDP transport layer.


## Error Handling

Although using UDP does not ensure reliability of data transfer, the actual rate of packet loss or corruption in LAN
may be too low to test your program.  Therefore, we are going to emulate packet loss by using `tc` command in linux.

- The file transmission should be completed successfully, unless the packet loss rate is 100%.
- The timer on both the client and the server should work correctly to retransmit the lost packet.

### Examples to emulate packet loss

- Run the below commands to emulate packet loss at either the client or the server side.

    * First, you want to check the tc command options of your network interface (eth0 is used in this example)

            tc qdisc show dev eth0

    * You can add a rule to randomly drop 10% of packets on eth0.

	        tc qdisc add dev eth0 root netem loss 10%

    * After adding the above rule, both the client and the server should retransmit some packets due to the packet loss. You can check the retransmission on the output message

    * To delete the rule:

	        tc qdisc del dev eth0 root

    * You can re-order the packet. The below command causes every 5th (10th, 15th, ...) packet to go to be sent immediately and every other packet to be delayed by 100ms.

	        tc qdisc change add eth0 root netem gap 5 delay 100ms

    * More examples can be found in [Network Emulation tutorial](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/networking/netem)


## Congestion Control

Your server has to adjust the congestion window size depending on the link status.  **Note that for the full credit you need implement only TCP Tahoe congestion window adjustment logic**:

- *Slow start*: the congestion window size will be doubled until it meets the slow start threshold value (`ssthresh`).
- *Congestion Avoidance*: the congestion window size added by one if the congestion window size is larger than `ssthresh`.
- If a packet is lost as detected by the retransmission timeout

  * The server sets `ssthresh` to 1/2 of current congestion window and
  * set congestion window to 1

In other words, after timeout, the sender adjusts the value of `sshthresh` and moves back to *Slow Start* stage.  As soon as the value of `cwnd` reaches `sshthresh`, it switches to *Congestion Avoidance*.  As soon as packet lost, the server again adjusts `sshthresh`, set `cwnd` to 1, and restart from *Congestion Avoidance* stage.

When you done with the basic project, you can continue with implementing TCP Reno and/or TCP NewReno congestion window adjustment logic for extra credit.

## Hints

The best way to approach this project is in incremental steps.  Do not try to implement all of the functionality at once.

- First, assume there is no packet loss. Just have the server send a packet, the receiver respond with an ACK,
and so on.

- Second, introduce a large file transmission. This means you must divide the file into multiple packets and transmit the packets based on the current congestion window size.

- Third, introduce packet loss.  Now you have to add a timer at the sender side for each packet. Also congestion control features should be implemented for the successful file transmission.

The credit of your project is distributed among the required functions. If you only finish part of the requirements, we still
give you partial credit. So please do the project incrementally.



## Requirements

- You must use an UDP socket for both sender and receiver.

- You should print messages to the screen when the server or the client is sending or receiving packets. There
are four types of output messages and should follow the formats below.

    * Server: Sending data packets

            "Sending data packet" [Sequence number] [CWND] [SSThresh] ("Retransmission")

        Example:

	        Sending data packet 5096 16 10
	        Sending data packet 6000 16 10
	        Sending data packet 6020 16 10
	        Sending data packet 5096 1 8 Retransmission

    * Server: Receiving ACK packets

	        "Receiving ACK packet" [ACK number]

        Example:

            Receiving ACK packet 5096
            Receiving ACK packet 6020

    * Client: Sending ACK packets

	        "Sending ACK packet" [ACK number] ("Retransmission")

        Example:

            Sending ACK packet 5096
            Sending ACK packet 6000
            Sending ACK packet 6020
            Sending ACK packet 5096 Retransmission

    * Client: Receiving data packets

            "Receiving data packet" [Sequence number]

        Example:

            Receiving data packet 5096
            Receiving data packet 6020

- The maximum packet size is 1 Kbytes (1024 bytes) including a header.

- The receiver and congestion window sizes must be in **the unit of bytes**, not in the unit of packet count. For example, if the minimum of the congestion and receiver windows is 5000 bytes, then five packets with payload of 1000 bytes each can be transmitted simultaneously (including length, each packet will be 1008 bytes).

- The sequence number is given in **the unit of bytes** as well. The maximum sequence number should correspond to **30 Kbytes (30720 bytes)**. You have to reset back the sequence number when it reaches the maximum value.

- Packet retransmission should be triggered when the timer times out.

- Here are the default values for some variables.

    * Maximum packet length (including all your headers): **1024 bytes**
    * Maximum sequence number: **30720 bytes**
    * Initial congestion window size: **1024 byte**
    * Initial slow start threshold: **30720 bytes**
    * Retransmission time out value: **500 ms**
    * The basic client's receiver window can be always **30720 bytes**, but the server should be able to properly handle cases when the window is reduced.

- Simple TCP header format

    * Your simple TCP header should follow the below format which is 8 bytes fixed size.

             0                   1                   2                   3
             0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |        Sequence Number        |     Acknowledgment Number     |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |             Window            |          Not Used       |A|S|F|
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    * `Sequence Number` (16 bits): The sequence number of the first data octet in this packet (except when SYN is present). If SYN is present the sequence number is the initial sequence number (ISN) and the first data octet is ISN+1.

    * `Acknowledgement Number` (16 bits): If the ACK control bit is set this field contains the value of the next sequence number the sender of the segment is expecting to receive.  Once a connection is established this is always sent.

    * `Window` (16 bits): The number of data octets the sender of this packet is willing to accept.

    * `Not Used` (13 bits): Must be zero.

    * `A` (ACK, 1 bit): Indicates that there the value of `Acknowledgment Number` field is valid

    * `S` (SYN, 1 bit): Synchronize sequence numbers (TCP connection establishment)

    * `F` (FIN, 1 bit): No more data from sender (TCP connection termination)

## Environment Setup

The best way to guarantee full credit for the project is to do project development using a Ubuntu 14.04-based virtual machine.

You can easily create an image in your favourite virtualization engine (VirtualBox, VMware, Docker) using the Vagrant platform and steps outlined below.

### Set up Vagrant and create VM instance

**Note that all example commands are executed on the host machine (your laptop), e.g., in Terminal.app (or iTerm2.app) on OS X, cmd in Windows, and console or xterm on Linux.  After the last step (`vagrant ssh`) you will get inside the virtual machine and can compile your code there.**

- Download and install your favourite virtualization engine, e.g., [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

- Download and install [Vagrant tools](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) for your platform

- Set up project and VM instance

  * Clone project template

        git clone https://github.com/cawka/spring16-cs118-project2 ~/cs118-proj2
        cd ~/cs118-proj2

  * Initialize VM

        vagrant up

  * To establish an SSH session to the created VM, run

        vagrant ssh

  If you are using Putty on Windows platform, `vagrant ssh` will return information regarding the IP address and the port to connect to your virtual machine.

- Work on your project

  All files in `~/cs118-proj2` folder on the host machine will be automatically synchronized with `/vagrant` folder on the virtual machine.  For example, to compile your code, you can run the following commands:

        vagrant ssh
        cd /vagrant
        make

### Notes

* If you want to open another SSH session, just open another terminal and run `vagrant ssh` (or create a new Putty session).

* If you are using Windows, read [this article](http://www.sitepoint.com/getting-started-vagrant-windows/) to help yourself set up the environment.

* The code base contains the basic `Makefile` and two empty files `server.cpp` and `client.cpp`.

        $ vagrant ssh
        vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-xenial-64:~$ cd /vagrant
        vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-xenial-64:/vagrant$ ls
        Makefile  README.md  Vagrantfile  client.cpp  server.cpp


* You are now free to add more files and modify the Makefile to make the `server` and `client` full-fledged implementation.


## Submission

To submit your project, you need to prepare:

1. All your source code and Makefile (no binaries) as `.tar.gz` archive.

2. A PDF project report that describes
   * the high level design of your server and client;
   * the problems your ran into and how you solved the problems;
   * additional instructions to build your project (if your project uses some other libraries);
   * how you tested your code and why.
   * the contribution of each team member (up to 3 members in one team) and their UID

Put all these above into a package and submit to CCLE.

Please make sure:

1. your code can compile
2. no unnecessary files in the package.

Otherwise, your will not get any credit.

## Grading

Your code will be first checked by a software plagiarism detecting tool. If we find any plagiarism, you will not get any credit.

Your code will then be automatically tested in some testing scenarios. If your code can pass all our automated test cases, you will get the full credit.

###  Bonus points

You can have:

* 1 extra point if you implement RTT estimation and adaptive RTO, as defined in TCP specification
* 1 extra point if you implement TCP Reno or TCP NewReno fast retransmission and recovery
* (**Very complicated. Proceed with caution**) 4 extra points if you replace TCP transport in your project-1 with the transport you have implemented in this project, which should involve:
  - creating a proper socket-like abstraction for your transport
  - bidirectional data flow (client will need to send request and server will need to send reply)
  - support for multiple parallel connections
